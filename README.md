# NerdHack-SafeBike
SafeBike is a bike safety system that triggers an alert to the user when their bike leaves a user-defined periphery.  
The Current version of the system tracks sensors in real-time and allows the user to identify online if the bike is stolen or not. 

SafeBike was launched at NerdHack 2018, held from Mar 30-31 at ASU Poly. 
I worked in a team of four, where we developed a website using ServiceNow's web platform.
The website allowed the user to track their bike and know if it was stolen or safe. 
For the purpose of demonstration, we used smartphones with GPS enabled to act as sensors, with the ServiceNow app communicating the location with the instance we developed. 

My role involved designing all the webpages(HTML, CSS), leveraging ServiceNow's tools to link the webpages, handle widgets, and designing the presentation.

My team placed first and won $1000 worth of Amazon credit.
